### SALES ANALYSIS PROJECT

### OVERVIEW

Retail stores operate in a competitive and dynamic environment, where sales performance is a key indicator of success. Analyzing sales performance enables a store to assess its profitability, understand customer purchasing patterns, and identify factors driving or hindering revenue growth. In this analysis, we aim to examine critical metrics, trends, and factors influencing sales performance in the retail context, considering various products, seasonal patterns, customer demographics, and marketing strategies.

### PROJECT OBJECTIVE
To perform initial exploration of Sales Data and use pivot tables to summarize total sales by product, region and month.
